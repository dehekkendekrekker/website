I have equipped the laser with a honey comb bed. The previous bed was a rudamentary pin bed made of aluminium profiles 
and bolts. The distances between the pins was too large, causing the parts to flip and get hit by the laser head.
This in turn would move the board, causing mis-alignment and ruining the job. 

The bed consists of 2 60x60 panels. I had to do some custom hacking as the honeycomb comes in a square frame.
So, I had to remove one side of the frame. Fortunately, the frame is rivetted, which can be drilled out. I repurposed
some of the aluminium profiles to act as a support under the honey-comb where the mesh meets, so it won't get all wobbly
and maintains solidness.
