title: "Breadboarding VCO complete"
date: 2024-01-31
draft: false
---

The breadboarding is pretty much done. The beasty works on the scope. I have not been able to actually get some audio out of it yet,
because I have not built the module that will adapt the signal to something that can be used by an amp or headphones.
Also, I do not have an amp yet, nor monitor speaker yet, nor any idea of what to get :)

Calibration turns out to be a bit of a SoB. It is hard to get a good wave-form that will persist. When I tap one of the pots,
ever so slightly, the shape distorts. This was giving me a head-ache, and I'm blaming the breadboard. 
I have made a PCB design. (available [here](https://github.com/dehekkendekrekker/synth/)). It's just for the VCO at this  moment. 
When it is ordered, I'll build it and I hope the problem magically goes away.
