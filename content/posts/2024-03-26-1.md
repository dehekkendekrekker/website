The circuitboard layout design of the VCO has been completed. My tool of choice to design circuitboard is KiCAD. 
I have evaluated Altium Designer, but as far as I can see, for simple designs KiCAD fits the bill. The only thing
KiCAD is missing, but Altium has, is a way to link part to a manufacturer and supplier so one can quickly select parts,
see stock,find alternatives etc.

However, I digress. The design is available [here](https://github.com/dehekkendekrekker/synth).

Also, I had the design fabricated by [dirtypcbs.com](https://dirtypcbs.com). They provide a cheap, no-nonse PCB fabrication service.
You can get a protopack of ~10 units. My order contained 19 boards. so if the design contains no error I could make 19 oscillators! (yay)
