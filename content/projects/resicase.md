## Intro
This page documents the development of a storage system of resistors. The thing I have in mind is to put the resistors 
in test tubes, and then put the test tubes in a wooden case in a 2 dimensional grid. Then each hole will have a LED
behind it. The case will have 2 knobs to control X and Y. This way you can select the value you want, which will then light up.
Useful for low-light situation, and I think it's pretty cool overall.

## Fase 1
Make design. Done, pics will follow

## Fase 2
Get test tubes, and label them. Done!
