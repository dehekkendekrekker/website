        <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>I have been interested in analog synths lately, and since I am a solder junkie in need of a fix, I figured will build one of my own.</p>
<p>A surprisingly short journey led me to the late Ray Wilson&rsquo;s <a href="http://musicfromouterspace.com/">music from outer space site</a></p>
<p>This site is a treasure trove of schematics, explanations, alternative part indication and more.</p>
<p>I picked up his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Make-Analog-Synthesizers-Ray-Wilson/dp/1449345220/">Make: Analog synthesizers</a>, which is a good introduction for the budding electronics enthusiast as well as more experienced power users who are just getting into analog.</p>
<p>Having no idea what VCO mean, or LFO and VCA for that matter a couple of weeks worth of evenings were spent getting my bearings, so how does of all of this work?</p>
<p>VCO means voltage controlled oscillator and is the part in a synth that makes a sound. So it takes an input voltage, and the oscillator goes bzzz, making a tone. By manipulating the voltage you can change the pitch of the tone!</p>
<p>So Ray&rsquo;s oscillator is a 1V/Oct VCO, which means that for every volt change, the pitch changes one octave.</p>
<p>It has some features such as, sawtooth, square, sine and ramp wave shape generation as well as temperature compensation.</p>
<h2 id="plan">Plan</h2>
<p>The designs are ready, the parts are ordered. I will make a protoboard version of the VCO first. Then I will make a PCB design,
have a bunch made, order  more parts and build some more VCO for a litte oomph. Think polyphonic, chords, etc.</p>
<h2 id="status">Status</h2>
<p>As of yet, I have transposed his design into KiCAD. This gives me better control over which parts to use and the generation of the bill of materials. I have ordered the parts from mouser, which should ship them soon.</p>
<h2 id="download-design-files">Download design files</h2>
<p>The transposed MFOS VCO design as well as other MFOS designs are available on <a href="https://github.com/dehekkendekrekker/synth/">github</a></p>
<p>Keep in mind that the work is Ray Wilson&rsquo;s IP, on the bottom of the <a href="http://musicfromouterspace.com/index.php">MFOS site</a> he specifies:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Please feel free to use the information presented on the MFOS website to the fullest extent for non-commercial uses.
You can make your own PCBs from the layouts and drawings we provide or design your own if you prefer.
</code></pre><p>So this also goes for the KiCAD designs that I made. <strong>Non-commercial use only.</strong></p>
